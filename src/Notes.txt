React Query helps to manage state of service same as like redux and contetx api . 

Both redux and context api help to manage state of client , but tanstack helps to manage state of server

Generally react query have two things : 

Query  : Used to simple fetch the data 
Mutations : Unlike queries, mutations are typically used to create/update/delete data or perform server side-effects

React query does not provide http client it just provide feature to manage the state of server 
here we can use any kind of http client like 
. inbuilt javascript function (fetch)
. use any other library like axios
